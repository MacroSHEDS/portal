GENERAL
verify timezones for all hbef data
logging
http requests fail randomly?
    Error in the HTTP2 framing layer
    could just tryCatch and repeat
prefix all imported function calls with package name::
restyle everything
    max 80 char lines
    <- into =
    etc


APP LAYOUT
map page
    choose one site and jump straight to site exploration page or
    choose more sites and jump to restricted comparisons page
gapminder page (not till year 3)
restricted comparisons page
    annual, seasonal, maybe finer scale comparisons across domains
    comparisons only allowed between sites with similar treatments, characteristics, etc (e.g. nutrient addition, cutting)
site exploration page (carolina free-for-all page)

DATA RETRIEVAL
out and in folders for all data i retrieve
within the in folder, have separate feather files that represent
    1. all combined raw objects
    2. all objects groups
    3. all together, final feather


SCHEMA DESIGN
option 1 (doc store):
users
activity
sourcedata
    data source
        sitegroup
            site
                continuous (constant/irregular interval)
                    timestamp
                    data
                    flag
                grab
                    timestamp
                    data
                    flag
                watershed summary
                    data
                blob
                    data
                meta

option 2 (doc store):
users
activity
site
    [1, data source, sitegroup, site]
continuous
    [1, dt, var, val, flag]
    [2, dt, var, val, flag]
grab
    same
summary
    [3, var, val, flag]
blob

CURRENT GOALS
goal 1 - tweak free-for-all tab:
    hide most recent year
    include all available sensor data
    change R, F, L, PK limb display (what do these mean?)
    figure out if ET or UTC
    change plots to dygraphs
    facet plots somehow (see matt's app for example)
        should facet dynamically as more sites/vars are chosen
        should maybe facet according to var or unit grouping
        list of variables should be grouped by unit, etc
        legend should include units
        put units on y axis (formatted), and varnames in legend

QUESTIONS FOR MATT:
    look over units sheet

QUESTIONS FOR EMILY:
    do we need to hide the most recent hbef year from viz? or just not let people download it?
