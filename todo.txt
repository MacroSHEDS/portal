either compare annual (or subseassonal) sujmary data across study systems or (2)
    evernt based stuff within systems (3)

start with page divided 1/3-2/3 map of sites and gapminder summary biplot
    choose one site and jump straight to 3 or
    choose more sites and jump to 2

goal 1 - tweak free-for-all tab:
    hide most recent year
    include all available sensor data
    change R, F, L, PK limb display (what do these mean?)
    figure out if ET or UTC
    change plots to dygraphs
    facet plots somehow (see matt's app for example)
        should facet dynamically as more sites/vars are chosen
        should maybe facet according to var or unit grouping
        list of variables should be grouped by unit, etc

questions for emily:
    do we need to hide the most recent hbef year from viz? or just not let people download it?
