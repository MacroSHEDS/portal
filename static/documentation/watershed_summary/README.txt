This MacroSheds product represents spatial *and* temporal watershed summary statistics of
gridded data products available primarily through Google Earth Engine.

Each watershed summary variable is prefixed with a two-letter code. The first letter
designates the variable's category (variable_category_code), and the second indicates
its source (data_source_code). We use these codes internally as a compact way to store
variable metadata that is used to filter this dataset. You may do the same, using the
included variable_category_codes.csv and data_source_codes.csv. For more information
about each variable, see the included columns.csv.

For the full, temporally-explicit dataset from which these watershed summary statistics were
generated, see the "Watershed data, complete" section of "Spatial data and GIS files", under
the Download tab on macrosheds.org.
