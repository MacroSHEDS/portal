This MacroSheds product represents spatial watershed averages of gridded data products available
primarily through Google Earth Engine. For most of these products, grids are generated on a recurring
basis. We here report watershed averages for each gridded product at whatever temporal
interval is available, up to daily (as in the case of e.g. PRISM precip). For some products,
only a few temporal "snapshots" are available. Still, in every case, we report these spatial
averages as time-series data.

Each watershed summary variable is prefixed with a two-letter code. The first letter
designates the variable's category (variable_category_code), and the second indicates
its source (data_source_code). We use these codes internally as a compact way to store
variable metadata that is used to filter this dataset.  You may do the same, using the
included variable_category_codes.csv and data_source_codes.csv. For more information
about these variables, download the Variable table from the Data tab.

For spatio-temporal summary statistics of each watershed, see the "Watershed summary statistics"
section of "Spatial data and GIS files", under the Download tab on macrosheds.org.
