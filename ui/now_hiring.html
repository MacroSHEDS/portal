    <h1 id="macrosheds-now-hiring">MacroSheds is now hiring postdocs and research associates!</h1>
    <p>
        MacroSheds is dedicated to unlocking the scientific insights within watershed data. Our team (Duke, Colorado State) has been harmonizing data from land and waterways in the US and beyond, and now we're ready to do BIG watershed science!
    </p>
    <p>
        This project has at least four more years of funding and ample room to grow, so we're looking for up to three new team members. We want you if you excel in one or more of these domains:

        <h3>Data Science/Programming/Visualization</h3>
        <p>
            Our platform consists of a <a href="https://github.com/MacroSHEDS/data_processing" style="color: blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">processing pipeline</a>
            and a <a href="https://github.com/MacroSHEDS/portal" style="color: blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data portal</a>.
            The pipeline is an automated system for acquiring and munging time-series and spatial data from a growing list of sources:
            <a href="https://lternet.edu/" style="color: blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LTER</a>,
            <a href="https://criticalzone.org/" style="color: blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CZO/CZ Net</a>,
            <a href="https://data.neonscience.org" style="color: blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEON</a>,
            <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/catalog" style="color: blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USFS</a>,
            DOE. Raw precipitation, discharge, and chemistry go in, and derived products (solute flux, basin-average precip, etc.) come out. We then connect these data streams to our portal, where anyone can explore watershed biogeochemistry through interactive visualization.

        <h3>Science/Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            This project is motivated by several core questions, including:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    How and why do watersheds vary in the magnitude, timing and form of nitrogen exports?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How does a history of watershed acidification affect the magnitude, timing and composition of ecosystem element exports?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What attributes of watershed ecosystems determine their sensitivity to climate change?
                </li>
            </ol>
            It is also a doorway to vast wildernesses of further inquiry.

        <h3>Science Communication/Outreach/Team Management</h3>
        <p>
            Our portal and dataset are complex! But we want them to be useful to everyone with an interest in watershed ecology or biogeochemistry, so we need a set of friendly informational resources to guide users along. We'll also be hosting data camps, where early-career scientists and engineers will design interactive "data stories" to convey our findings.

    <h2>NSF Public abstract</h2>
    <p>
        This project enables anyone with internet access to compare the flow and the chemistry of hundreds of streams throughout the United States and to explore their watersheds. It combines data sets from many separate research projects into an attractive website that makes the data available. This makes it easy for scientists and students to generate questions about water quality and river flow patterns across the continent. Researchers will use these data to study what types of watersheds are best at retaining nutrients, are recovering most rapidly from decades of acid rain, have the highest erosion rates, and have flow patterns that are least sensitive to floods and droughts. The lessons we learn from studying many watersheds and streams will contribute to more effective management of our nationâ€™s water and forest resources.

    <p>
        Much of the literature of watershed ecosystem science over the last decade has focused on gaining ever finer detail of spatial heterogeneity within watersheds. This fine-scale focus has identified many idiosyncrasies of individual watersheds but has not helped us develop general theories about watershed dynamics. Most watershed ecosystem studies remain rather parochial, involving detailed studies of individual or paired watersheds, or surveys of a small set of attributes across multiple watersheds. Macrosystem watershed science, or the search for general principles that describe the functional capacity and behavior across watersheds, has been limited. A major reason for this lack of large-scale focus has been the challenge of data access and integration across sites. Our goal is to compile a dataset that merges all US watershed ecosystem studies into a common platform (MacroSheds) and to enable and train a new generation of watershed ecosystem scientists in the art and practice of macroscale watershed ecosystem science.
